## Lessons Learned
.
- My code writing style became cleaner as we had used ES6 to write code and used import export so that code become well structured.
- I learn about many CSS properties that I didn't know before.
- My skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.
- We all learned how to plan a project and execute that in a limited time frame.
